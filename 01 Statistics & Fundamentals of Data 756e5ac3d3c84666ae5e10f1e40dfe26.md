### Statistics
- Study of collecting, organizing, analyzing and interpreting data.
- It is both a science of uncertainty and a technology of extracting information from the data that helps us to make useful decisions.

### Importance of Statistics
- To summarize huge quantities of data.
- To make better business & analytical decisions.
- To recognize patterns that can refine how we do everything from selling diapers to catching criminals.
- To make sense of the data: To answer important socio-economic questions, to evaluate the effectiveness of policies, programs, drugs, medical procedures, and other innovations, to catch cheaters and prosecute criminals.

### What are the types of statistics?

#### 1. Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics is the process where we summarize, describe & collect the key features of the gathered data (population or a sample). 
    
Descriptive statistics is used to study & analyze the collected data; and the conclusions that are drawn from using descriptive statistics is backed by the data.
    
 Example: From the collected data, we can determine the average age, age distribution or sex ratio, etc.
    
#### 2. Inferential Statistics
Inferential statistics involves method of using information from a sample to draw conclusions regarding the population. 
    
Inferential statistics can say a lot about population by analyzing sample data (indirectly/directly by taking hints by using sample data).
    
Example: You randomly select a sample of 11th graders in your state and collect data on their SAT scores among other characteristics. You can use inferential statistics to make estimates and test hypotheses about the whole population of 11th graders in the state based on your sample data.

### What is the meaning of "individuals" and "variables" in statistics?
- Individuals are people/objects/records included in a study. 
Example: 5 individuals could be 5 people, 5 records or 5 reports.
- Variable is a characteristic of the individual to be measured or observed. 
Example: Age of an individual, time an individual is recorded.

### Differences between population and sample?

| Population | Sample |
| --- | --- |
| A group of people or objects with a common theme. When every member of the group is considered, it is a population. | A small portion of the population is called a sample. A sample can be representative/biased. |
| Example: <br>- Nurses working at a specific hospital <br>- Citizens of a country. | Example: <br>Biased sample - Nurses only from ICU ward in a hospital. <br> Representative sample - One nurse from each department in a hospital. |

**Representative sample:** A sample that reflects population as accurately as possible.

### Differences between population parameter and a sample statistic?

| Population parameter | Sample statistic |
| --- | --- |
| It is a measure (mean, variance, etc.) that describes entire population. | It is a measure that describes only a sample of that population. |
| Examples: <br>- Mean heights of all dogs in the city. <br> - Median income of 850 college students in Boston.| Examples: <br> - Mean height of 100 random dogs in the city. <br> - Median income of all college students in Massachusetts. |

## Data & Types of data

Data is a distinct piece of information recorded and used for analysis.

### Categorical (Qualitative) Data

Data in the form of labels, categories & numbers (with ordering).

Categorical data is collection of information that is divided into groups.

1. <u>**Binary data**</u> - The data can take only two possible values. Example: Toss of a coin, On/Off, 0/1, etc.
2. <u>**Nominal & Ordinal data </u>** - 
    **Nominal data** - Nominal data is a type of categorical data where data is coded in a manner to represent a label. <br>Example: Names of cars, book titles and marital status.
    **Ordinal data** - Data is ordered and follows a natural hierarchy. <br>Example: Customer satisfaction score, rank lists, movie ratings, order of people in a line, etc.
 3.  <u>**Ratio and Interval data**</u> - 
	 **Ratio data** - Type of quantitative data where:
		- Thereâ€™s absolute/true zero-point.
		- Both differences and ratios between two values are meaningful.

		**Interval data** - Type of quantitative data where:
		- Thereâ€™s no absolute/true zero point. If data is zero, it does not indicate the absence of the attribute being measured.
		- Difference between the values are meaningful but ratio between the values are not.


| Interval Data | Ratio Data |
|---|---|
| Absolute point zero is arbitrary; i.e., mathematical meaning of zero is not maintained. | Thereâ€™s an absolute-zero value. |
| The lack of absolute point-zero makes direct magnitudes impossible. <br>Example (1): Object A is twice as object B is not a possibility in interval data. <br> Example (2): Temperature measured in celsius scale. 20Â°C is NOT twice as warm as 10Â°C.| The presence of absolute zero point makes direct magnitudes valid. <br>Example (1): The quantity of 20 measured in ratio scale is twice the value of 10. <br> Example (2): Temperature measured in kelvin scale. 20K is twice as warm as 10K.|
| A variable can be measured even it has a negative value. <br>Example: Temperatures like:  $-10^0C$. | There cannot be any negative commercial value in ratio data. Example: A variable in kelvin scale. Point zero is absolute. There cannot be a temperature below 0 in kelvin scale.  |
| Other examples: IQ test results, SAT scores. (IQ of 0 do not exist). | Other example: Heights (in cm, km. etc). Distances between two points. |

### Numerical (Quantitative) Data

1. **Discrete** - Data of integer values, based on counts of some events. 

Examples: 
* Purchases made by a customer in a year.
* People in a room.
* Number of items in a basket, etc.

2. **Continuous** - Data where values are real numbers & hence can take infinite number of possible values. 
Examples: 
* Height
* Weight
* Sales
* Account balance, etc.

### Differences between qualitative and quantitative data?

| Qualitative Data (Categorical) | Quantitative Data (Numerical) |
| --- | --- |
| Data is descriptive in nature. | Data is numerical. |
| Describes attributes that can be observed but not measured. | Captures measure of an attribute. |
| Example: Flavors in an ice-cream, hair colors, profession, car models, etc. | Examples: Heights of students, cost of a car, Age of a person, etc. |

### Differences between descriptive and inferential statistics?

|  | Descriptive Statistics | Inferential Statistics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purpose | Summarizes and describes the collected data. | Draws conclusions and make predictions about population based on sample data. |
| Data analysis | Analyzes and interprets the characteristics of a dataset. | Uses sample data to make generalizations or predictions about a larger population. |
| Population vs Sample | Focuses on the entire population. | Focuses on subset of a population to draw conclusions on entire population. |
| Measurement tools & techniques | Uses measures of central tendency and dispersion, like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, range, variance, skewness, etc. | Uses methods like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis, ANOVA (analysis of variance), chi-square tests, t-tests, etc. |
| Goal | To summarize, organize & present data. | Generalize findings to a larger population, make predictions, test hypotheses, evaluate relationships, and support decision-making. |
